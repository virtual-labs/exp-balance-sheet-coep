Here are the procedures for interpreting and preparing energy balance and material balance sheets for a process plant as per standard:

##### Energy Balance

###### Step 1 : Gather Data

Collect relevant data on energy inputs and outputs, including:
-	Fuel consumption (e.g., natural gas, fuel oil, coal)
-	Electricity consumption
-	Steam generation and usage
-	Heat transfer fluids (e.g., hot oil, thermal fluid)
-	Cooling systems (e.g., cooling water, air cooling)
-	Review process flow diagrams (PFDs), piping and instrumentation diagrams
	
(P&IDs), and other process documents to identify energy-using equipment and systems.

###### Step 2 : Identify Energy Streams

Identify the various energy streams in the process, including:
-	Heat energy (e.g., steam, hot oil, furnace heat)
-	Mechanical energy (e.g., electricity, compressed air)
-	Chemical energy (e.g., fuel, reactants)
-	Categorize energy streams as either:
-	Energy inputs (e.g., fuel, electricity)
-	Energy outputs (e.g., steam, hot oil)
-	Energy losses (e.g., heat losses, electrical losses)
	
###### Step 3 : Calculate Energy Flows

Calculate the energy flows for each energy stream, including:
-	Energy input rates (e.g., kW, BTU/h)
-	Energy output rates (e.g., kW, BTU/h)
-	Energy loss rates (e.g., kW, BTU/h)
Use standard units and conversion factors, such as:
-	1 kW = 3413 BTU/h
-	1 ton of steam = 12,000 BTU/h
	
###### Step 4 : Prepare the Energy Balance Sheet

Prepare the energy balance sheet, including:
-	Energy inputs (fuel, electricity, etc.)
-	Energy outputs (steam, hot oil, etc.)
-	Energy losses (heat losses, electrical losses, etc.)
-	Net energy usage (energy inputs - energy outputs - energy losses)
	
Present the energy balance sheet in a clear and concise format, using tables, charts, or graphs as necessary.

##### Material Balance

###### Step 1: Gather Data

Collect relevant data on material inputs and outputs, including:
-	Raw materials (e.g., feedstocks, reactants)
-	Products (e.g., final products, by-products)
-	Intermediate streams (e.g., process streams, recycle streams)
-	Waste streams (e.g., effluent, emissions)
-	Review process flow diagrams (PFDs), piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs), and other process documents to identify material streams and flow rates.
	
###### Step 2 : Identify Material Streams

Identify the various material streams in the process, including:
-	Feed stocks (e.g., raw materials, reactants)
-	Products (e.g., final products, by-products)
-	Intermediate streams (e.g., process streams, recycle streams)
-	Waste streams (e.g., effluent, emissions)
-	Categorize material streams as either:
-	Material inputs (e.g., feedstocks, reactants)
-	Material outputs (e.g., products, by-products)
-	Material losses (e.g., waste streams, emissions)
	
Step 3 : Calculate Material Flows
Calculate the material flows for each material stream, including:
-	Material input rates (e.g., kg/h, lb/h)
-	Material output rates (e.g., kg/h, lb/h)
-	Material loss rates (e.g., kg/h, lb/h)
	
Use standard units and conversion factors, such as:
1 kg = 2.20462 lb
1 ton = 2000 lb

###### Step 4 : Prepare the Material Balance Sheet

Prepare the material balance sheet, including:
-	Material inputs (feed stocks, reactants, etc.)
-	Material outputs (products, by-products, etc.)
-	Material losses (waste streams, emissions, etc.)
-	Net material usage (material inputs - material outputs - material losses)
-	Present the material balance sheet in a clear and concise format, using tables, charts, or graphs as necessary.
	
International standards that may be relevant to energy balance and material balance sheet preparation include :
-	ISO 50001:2018 - Energy management systems
-	ANSI/ASME PTC 19.1:2013 - Test uncertainty
-	API RP 560:2016 - Fired heaters for general refinery service
-	OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119: Process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals
	
Note : The specific steps and standards may vary depending on the industry, location, and specific requirements of the process plant.
